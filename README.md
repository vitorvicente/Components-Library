# VTR-REACT-COMPONENTS

The following is my personal library of React Components. I make use of these in my personal projects, although, 
technically, anyone else can also use them under the "vtr-react-components" package published on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vtr-react-components/v/0.0.2).

There are three non-API components people can access:
- VtrFooter
- VtrHeader
- Layout
